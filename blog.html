            <p>A television show is a series of related productions intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. More rarely, it may be a single production, also called a television program (British English: programme).</p>
            <h2>Chapter II</h2>
            <p>A limited number of episodes of a television show may be called a miniseries or a serial or limited series. A television series is without a fixed length and are usually divided into seasons (U.S. and Canada) or series (UK), yearly or semiannual sets of new episodes. While there is no defined length, U.S. industry practice has traditionally favored longer television seasons than those of other countries.</p> 
            <h2>Chapter III</h2>
            <p>A program can be either recorded, as on video tape, other various electronic media forms, played with an on-demand player or viewed on live television.</p>
